## About

This repository contains an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe (noughts and crosses) game. It is intended as an educational project to demonstrate basic game logic, board representation, and (optionally) simple AI.

## Features

- Two-player local gameplay (Human vs Human)
- Optional Human vs Computer mode (if an AI is included in the repo)
- Clean, easy-to-read code suitable for beginners
- Tests (if present) and examples demonstrating usage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A recent version of your language runtime (e.g., Python 3.8+, Node.js 14+, or the language used in this repo)
- Git

> Note: Replace the commands below with the appropriate ones for the language used in this repository.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/DrVanHelsing/TicTacToe.git
   cd TicTacToe

2. Install dependencies (if applicable)

   For Python (example):
   - python -m venv venv
   - source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

   For Node.js (example):
   - npm install

### Running the game

Run the main entry point for the project. Examples:

- Python:
  python main.py

- Node.js:
  node index.js

If a CLI or GUI is included, follow its prompts.

## Usage

- Follow on-screen prompts to place X or O on the board.
- In Human vs Computer mode, choose whether to play first or second (if supported).

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) onto an empty square of a 3x3 board.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Project Structure

- main files and folders (adjust to match the repository):
  - src/ or ./: game source code
  - tests/: unit tests
  - docs/: documentation
  - README.md: you are reading it

If the repository structure differs, update this section to reflect the actual layout.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue to discuss proposed changes or submit a pull request. Keep changes small and focused, include tests where appropriate, and follow the existing code style.

## License

Specify a license for your project (e.g., MIT). If there is already a LICENSE file, match that license here.

If you'd like, I can customize this README to match the exact language, run instructions, and AI details in the repository. Tell me which language the project uses and any specifics (AI difficulty, CLI/GUI, tests, license) and I'll update the README accordingly.
