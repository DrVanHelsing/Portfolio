# Hangman

## started & completed: April 2025

A simple Hangman game implementation. This repository contains the source code and supporting files to run a command-line (and/or GUI) Hangman game that selects words and prompts the player to guess letters until they win or are hanged.

> Note: This README was generated by GitHub Copilot. If anything needs updating (language/runtime, entrypoint, dependencies, screenshots, or license), edit the file or ask me to update it.

## Features

- Classic Hangman gameplay (guess letters to reveal a hidden word)
- Word list loaded from a dictionary file (configurable)
- Difficulty selection (easy / medium / hard) — if implemented
- Scorekeeping or round-based play — if implemented
- Clean and minimal command-line interface (or simple GUI if included)

## Demo

(If you have screenshots or an animated GIF add them here)

Example:

## Requirements

Specify runtime and dependencies here. Examples:

- Python 3.10+ (if the project is Python)
- Node.js 18+ (if JavaScript/Node)
- Java 17+ (if Java)
- Any extra packages or frameworks (e.g. pygame, curses, click, prompt-toolkit)

If the repository already contains a requirements.txt or package.json, refer to those for exact dependency details.

## Installation

Instructions for getting the project running locally.

Example (Python):

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/DrVanHelsing/Hangman.git
   cd Hangman

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Example (Node):

1. Clone and enter:
   git clone https://github.com/DrVanHelsing/Hangman.git
   cd Hangman

2. Install:
   npm install

## Usage

Explain how to run the game and the available options.

Example (Python CLI):

Run the game:
python hangman.py

Options:
- --difficulty [easy|medium|hard]
- --word-file path/to/words.txt
- --seed <num> (for reproducible runs)

Example (Node):

npm start
# or
node src/index.js

Describe keyboard controls, how guesses are submitted, how the game ends, etc.

## Configuration

Where to change settings such as:
- Word list file (words.txt)
- Maximum wrong guesses
- Difficulty word lengths
- UI/terminal colors

Example:
Edit config.json to change:
{
  "maxWrong": 6,
  "wordFile": "data/words.txt",
  "difficulty": "medium"
}

## Project Structure

A brief description of the repository layout (update to reflect actual files):

- hangman.py / src/index.js — main entrypoint
- words/words.txt — default word list
- src/ — source code
- docs/ — screenshots and docs
- tests/ — unit/integration tests
- requirements.txt / package.json — dependencies
- LICENSE — license file

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing! Suggested guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
- Make changes and add tests if applicable
- Open a pull request describing your change

Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT or CONTRIBUTING.md here if you want formal guidance.

## Testing

Describe how to run tests:

Example (Python/pytest):
pytest tests/

Example (Node/Jest):
npm test

If there are no tests yet, mention how contributors can add them.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes:

- "ModuleNotFoundError" — ensure virtualenv is activated and dependencies installed
- Missing words — ensure words/words.txt exists and is readable
- Terminal/encoding problems — run in UTF-8 locale

## License

This project does not include a license file. If you want to add a license, common choices are MIT, Apache-2.0, or GPL-3.0. If you prefer MIT, add a LICENSE file with your name and the current year.
