## Overview

This simulator recreates a realistic geological field environment entirely in the browser. The terrain is generated procedurally from multi-octave noise functions, carved by hydraulic erosion, and painted with physically-based rock textures. Six stratigraphic layers — from Precambrian basement to Quaternary alluvium — are deformed by regional folds, bedding perturbation, and a normal fault, creating a geologically plausible subsurface structure that students can investigate with a suite of virtual field instruments.

The application runs on commodity hardware (tested on Intel Iris Xe / i5 11th-gen / 12 GB RAM) and requires no installation beyond a modern browser and Node.js for development.

## Features

### Terrain & Landscape
- **2 km × 2 km procedural terrain** at 384 × 384 segment resolution (~148 K vertices)
- **Mountain ranges**: NW and NE ridge belts generated with ridge noise and directional masks
- **Rolling hills**: mid-frequency FBM across the map
- **V-shaped valleys**: absolute-value noise drainage carving
- **Plateaus / mesa shapes**: broad positive noise features
- **Edge falloff**: terrain lowers towards map boundaries (island-style)
- **Hydraulic erosion**: 38,000 particle-based droplet iterations sculpt realistic drainage networks
- **River carving**: Serpent River follows 11 control points interpolated via Catmull-Rom splines (81 dense samples), with Hermite-smoothed parabolic channel cross-sections

- **Normal fault**: N-S oriented, 28 m down-throw to the east via sigmoid transition
- **Smooth layer blending**: 6 m transition zones between adjacent layers using fractional layer indices

### Water
- **Unified water rendering**: All three water bodies (ocean, lakes, river) share the same high-quality shading pipeline — Fresnel-Schlick (F0=0.04, pow 4), quad sun specular (2048+512+64+12 power), fbm3 micro-ripple normal perturbation, sparkle/sun-glitter, forward+back subsurface scattering, 3-octave caustics, horizon-colour reflection blending, and sun-lit diffuse
- **Ocean**: Horizon-scale 8-wave Gerstner surface (20 km × 20 km, 400×400 grid) with distance-based amplitude fade. Shore waves — 3 overlapping inward-moving breaking wave components near the island coastline (650–1050 m), with noise-randomised timing so breakers arrive at different times and places. Deep-ocean darkening at distance, horizon-haze fog blending
- **Lakes**: 5 individual water surfaces (128-segment geometry, 8 Gerstner waves scaled to unit-circle) with rim-tracking raised water levels (+1.8 m above rim), finite-difference normals, centre-depth darkening tint
- **River**: Catmull-Rom ribbon mesh with 5-frequency downstream flow waves, finite-difference flow-aware normals, flow-aligned caustics, edge foam with noise-driven patterns near banks, variable width, and channel-floor-relative water height — visible directional flow animation

### Vegetation & Structures
- **Trees**: 600 pines (3-layered cones), 450 oaks (lumpy merged spheres), 250 birches (near-water preference)
- **Bushes**: 2,500 instances with per-instance colour variation
- **Rocks**: 500 dodecahedron outcrops preferring steep slopes
- **Grass**: 9,000 thin plane blade tufts (matching mountain grass style)
- **Mountain vegetation**: 500 alpine shrubs, 400 wildflowers, 800 mountain grass (above ~120-130 m)
- **Riparian vegetation**: 600 dense grass patches, 500 wildflowers, 300 reeds, 300 shrubs (near water bodies)
- **Farm compound**: 6 buildings (farmhouse, 2 cottages, barn, workshop, storage) with foundations, roofs, windows, doors, chimneys; 2 silos with domes; hay bales; water trough; animal pen with post-and-rail fencing; 4 crop fields with rows; dirt paths; perimeter fence; windmill with blades
- **All vegetation uses InstancedMesh** for GPU-efficient rendering

### Rendering
- **PBR Cook-Torrance BRDF** terrain shader with GGX NDF, Smith-Schlick geometry, Fresnel-Schlick, boosted ambient (×1.1) and enhanced rim Fresnel highlights
- **Tri-planar texture mapping** with 6-tile horizontal atlas (1024 px per tile)
- **Procedural PBR texture atlas**: albedo, normal (Sobel-derived), and packed roughness-AO-height maps per rock type
- **Detail normals** with distance-based LOD (macro ↔ detail blend) including ultra-close micro-detail tier
- **Terrain wetness** near water bodies: darker albedo, lower roughness, boosted F0
- **Physical atmospheric scattering** sky dome: Rayleigh + Mie, sun disc, animated clouds, haze bands
- **3D sun orb**: Emissive sun sphere (r=120) with BackSide glow sphere (r=300) positioned along sun direction at 6000 m, aligned with all shader sun directions and directional light
- **SSAO post-processing**: 12-tap rotated kernel with distance-adaptive radius and golden-angle sampling
- **Aerial perspective fog**: dual near/far colour exponential²
- **Boosted island lighting**: Sun intensity 3.0 (dynamic 2.0–3.2), hemisphere 1.25 (1.0–1.4), fill 0.75, rim 0.6, exposure 1.60, reduced fog density 0.00018 for bright, vivid island visuals
- **ACES Filmic tone mapping** at 1.60 exposure
- **Shadow mapping**: 2048² PCF soft shadows from directional sun light (positioned along shared sun direction vector, shadow frustum ±1400)

### Tools
1. **Rock Identifier (2)**: Click terrain to identify the geological layer — shows name, minerals, grain size, texture, fossils, age, and characteristics in a popup
2. **Drill Core (3)**: Virtual borehole sampling with configurable **inclination** (0–90°), **azimuth** (0–360°), and **max depth** — samples along an inclined borehole vector rather than vertical-only. Animated tripod rig marker with rotating collar, pulsing ground ring, and beacon; rig tilts via a pivot group to match drill orientation. Panel shows drill settings bar (3 numeric inputs), borehole compass SVG, visual core column with depth axis, colour-coded layer segments, and log entries
3. **Measure (4)**: Two-click distance/elevation measurement — glowing sphere markers on pins, curved dashed connecting line, label sprite showing 3D distance and elevation difference; panel shows horizontal distance, bearing, and slope angle
4. **Dip Direction / Dip (5)**: Bedding orientation measurement using **Dip Direction / Dip notation** (avoids right-hand-rule ambiguity). The 3D marker features a semi-transparent **bedding plane disc that tilts to match the actual bedding plane orientation** (rotated around the strike axis by the dip angle), a bold red **dip-direction arrow** with cone tip, **pulsing chevron half-rings** that animate along the tilted dip direction, and a horizontal **strike line** (stays flat by definition). Marker size, chevron count (1–3), arrow scale, and animation intensity all **scale with dip angle** — steeper dips produce larger, more energetic markers. Panel shows dip direction, dip angle, strike, with SVG Wulff net stereonet, 3D sphere visualisation, and compass symbol
5. **Cross-Section (6)**: Two-point geological profile — glowing pillar markers with numbered labels, terrain-following dashed line; panel renders a large canvas cross-section with layer colours, rock-type hatching patterns, water level indicator, surface profile, grid axes, and layer legend

### UI
- **Terrain-aligned hover cursor**: Blue double-ring hover indicator automatically orients parallel to the terrain surface normal — tilts on slopes, cliffs, and ridges to give instant visual feedback of local surface orientation
- **Dark-themed** interface styled after GitHub's design language
- **Sidebar** with tool and panel toggle buttons, custom SVG icon animations
- **Slide-out panel** with pin/unpin, backdrop click-away dismiss, Escape key close
- **Status bar**: real-time coordinates (X, Z), elevation, rock name, active tool
- **Compass**: 280 px canvas-drawn rotating compass with cardinal/intermediate labels, needle, and bearing readout
- **Scale bar**: camera-distance-adaptive with "nice" rounding (1, 2, 5, 10 … 5000 m)
- **Loading screen**: progress bar with stage messages (textures → heightmap → erosion → terrain → water → vegetation → SSAO → tools)
- **Layer manager**: reorder, add, remove geological layers
- **Settings panel**: water level, fog density, sun elevation
- **Field notebook**: free-text observations, location stamp, timestamp, PDF export (jsPDF)
- **Help modal**: Full-screen overlay with 4 tabbed sections (Camera Controls with mouse/keyboard visuals, Geological Tools with icons, Keyboard Shortcuts table, Tips & Tricks), backdrop blur, slide-up animation, Escape/H to toggle
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: 1-6 for tools, L for legend, N for notebook, H for help, Escape to dismiss

## Terrain Generation

The terrain is built in stages, each feeding into the next:

1. **Noise initialisation**: Two seeded simplex noise functions (`seed=42`, `seed=137`)
2. **Multi-octave heightmap** (385 × 385 grid):
   - Base continental floor at 80 m + 6-octave FBM (±55 m)
   - NW mountain ridge belt: ridge noise × 120 m × Gaussian mask (R=650 m)
   - NE secondary range: ridge noise × 80 m × mask (R=500 m)
   - Rolling hills: 4-octave FBM × 30 m
   - V-shaped valleys: |noise| × 25 m (subtracted)
   - Detail (3-octave × 8 m) + micro (2-octave × 2.5 m)
   - Plateau: max-clamped FBM × 18 m
   - Edge falloff: quadratic drop of 60 m beyond 85% map extent
3. **Farm flattening**: Hermite smoothstep blend to target elevation (95 m) within radius 160 m
4. **Lake carving**: 5 elliptical bowls with smoothstep blend + parabolic depth
5. **River carving**: Catmull-Rom subdivision (11 → 81 points), Hermite-smoothed parabolic cross-section, depth up to 28 m, width 30 m, blend zone 3.5× width
6. **Hydraulic erosion**: 38,000 particle-based droplets with inertia, sediment capacity, deposition, erosion radius, evaporation
7. **Geometry construction**: `PlaneGeometry(2000, 2000, 384, 384)` with per-vertex height, fractional layer index, and HSL-perturbed vertex colour

Height range: approximately 25–280 m. Water level: 38 m.

## Geological Model

### Stratigraphic Column

| Layer | Base Elevation | Age | Vegetation Density | Key Minerals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Granite Gneiss | 0 m | Precambrian (~1.8 Ga) | 0.05 | Quartz, K-Feldspar, Plagioclase, Biotite |
| Dolomitic Limestone | 40 m | Cambrian (~510 Ma) | 0.25 | Dolomite, Calcite, Minor Quartz |
| Sandstone & Shale | 75 m | Ordovician (~470 Ma) | 0.75 | Quartz, Feldspar, Clay minerals, Mica |
| Schist | 130 m | Silurian (~430 Ma) | 0.55 | Muscovite, Biotite, Garnet, Quartz |
| Limestone | 180 m | Devonian (~380 Ma) | 0.45 | Calcite, Aragonite, Minor Clay |
| Alluvium & Topsoil | 220 m | Quaternary (<2 Ma) | 1.0 | Clay, Quartz sand, Organic matter |

### Structural Deformation
- **Bedding perturbation**: Regional fold axis (~NE-SW, wavelength ~600 m) + two noise octaves = ±32 m vertical displacement
- **Normal fault**: Located at X=200, width=40 m, 28 m down-throw to the east via sigmoid function
- **Layer lookup**: elevation adjusted by perturbation + fault offset → lookup against base elevation thresholds

## Water System

### Unified Water Shading Pipeline
All three water bodies share the same fragment shader features:
- **Fresnel-Schlick** (F0=0.04, pow 4) for physically accurate view-dependent reflectivity
- **Quad sun specular** (2048+512+64+12 power) — tight core, bloom, wide glow, ultra-wide haze
- **Sun-path shimmer** — broad luminous streak toward camera (pow 8)
- **Sparkle / sun glitter** — noise-based micro-facet glints
- **fbm3 micro-ripple** normal perturbation for close-up detail
- **Forward + back subsurface scattering** with green-blue translucency
- **3-octave caustic shimmer**
- **Horizon-colour reflection blending** at grazing angles
- **Sun-lit diffuse** (0.22)
- **Fog with horizon-haze blending**

### Ocean
- Horizon-scale geometry: `PlaneGeometry(20000, 20000, 400, 400)` — 10× terrain size
- 8-wave Gerstner vertex displacement (frequencies 0.012–0.16, amplitudes 0.018–0.70, steepnesses 0.18–0.65) with distance-based amplitude fade
- **Shore waves**: 3 overlapping inward-moving breaking wave components near the island coastline (650–1050 m from centre), with noise-randomised timing so breakers arrive at different times and places, creating subtle random surf
- Normals computed from finite differences of the 8-wave displaced surface
- Distance-faded sparkle and caustics; deep-ocean darkening at distance
- Creates an island illusion — terrain appears as a landmass surrounded by open ocean stretching to the horizon

### Lakes
- 5 individual `CircleGeometry(1, 128)` surfaces scaled to elliptical lake dimensions
- Deeper basin carving (16–24 m depth) with raised water level (rim + 1.8 m)
- 8-wave Gerstner vertex displacement (lake-scaled frequencies) with finite-difference normals via `allWaves()` helper
- Centre-depth darkening tint for deeper lake interiors

### River
- Catmull-Rom subdivided ribbon mesh (81 cross-section pairs)
- Variable width along path (±20% sinusoidal)
- Water height = channel floor + 6 m
- 5-frequency downstream flow waves with finite-difference flow-aware normals
- Flow-aligned caustics scrolling downstream
- Edge foam: noise-driven foam pattern near riverbanks, simulating turbulence at shallow edges
- Edge-to-centre depth gradient for river cross-section colouring

---

## Vegetation & Structures

All vegetation types use `THREE.InstancedMesh` with per-instance colour via `setColorAt`. Placement is filtered by:
- Water exclusion (lakes, rivers — dense Catmull-Rom path checking)
- Farm exclusion zone
- Slope threshold (varies by type: 0.3–0.65)
- Geological layer vegetation density (probabilistic)
- Noise-based density clustering
- Elevation preferences (pines prefer >110 m, oaks prefer <170 m, birch near water)

**Total instanced objects**: ~18,000+ across all vegetation types.

---

## Rendering Pipeline

1. **Texture generation** — procedural PBR atlases (6 × 1024 px tiles: albedo, normal, RMH)
2. **Heightmap computation** — multi-octave noise → uint Float32Array
3. **Erosion simulation** — 38 K particle iterations in-place on heightmap
4. **Geometry build** — PlaneGeometry + per-vertex height/colour/layerIndex
5. **Scene assembly** — terrain, water (ocean + 5 lakes + river), atmosphere + sun orb + glow, vegetation, lighting (sun aligned with `_sunDir`)
6. **Render loop** (per frame):
   - Update orbit controls
   - Animate water (Gerstner time uniform)
   - Animate atmosphere (cloud/haze time)
   - Animate terrain wetness time
   - Animate tool markers (drill collar rotation, ring pulses, beacon glow, measure sphere emissive)
   - Render to off-screen target (colour + depth)
   - SSAO composite pass → screen

### Lighting
- Hemisphere light: sky 0x87ceeb / ground 0x4e6b3c, intensity 0.55 (boosted for lower sun angle)
- Directional sun: 0xfff4e0, intensity 1.6, positioned along shared `_sunDir` vector (0.75, 0.4, 0.45) × 1500, 2048² shadow map (frustum ±1400, far 4000), PCF soft shadows
- Fill light: 0x8fbbda, intensity 0.35, from opposite direction
- Rim light: 0xffd0a0, intensity 0.25, for edge definition
- 3D sun orb: emissive sphere + BackSide glow halo in AtmosphereSystem, positioned off-center at ~25° elevation for visibility from default camera angle

## Tools & Instruments

### Rock Identifier
Click any point to view the geological layer at that location. The layer is determined by elevation adjusted for bedding perturbation and fault offset.

### Drill Core
Samples an inclined borehole from surface downward, with user-configurable inclination (0–90° from vertical), azimuth (0–360° bearing), and maximum depth. The borehole vector follows the chosen orientation, sampling the deformed layer structure every 0.5 m along the drill path. The panel displays a drill settings bar (inclination, azimuth, depth inputs), a borehole compass SVG showing drill direction, a visual core column, depth axis, and detailed log entries. A 3D marker (tripod rig with rotating collar) is placed at the drill site; the rig tilts via a Y/X pivot group to match the configured drill inclination and azimuth.

### Measure
Two-click measurement computing: 3D distance, horizontal distance, elevation change, bearing (azimuth from North), and slope angle. Markers are glowing spheres on pins connected by a curved dashed line with a distance/elevation label sprite.

### Dip Direction / Dip
Central-difference gradient of the bedding perturbation surface at the clicked point yields dip magnitude and direction. Uses **Dip Direction / Dip notation** (dip direction stated first, followed by dip angle) to avoid right-hand-rule confusion. The 3D marker features a bedding plane disc that **tilts to match the actual bedding orientation** (rotated around the strike axis by the dip angle), a bold red dip-direction arrow with cone tip, pulsing chevron half-rings along the tilted dip direction, and a horizontal strike line. Marker size, animation speed, and chevron count **scale with dip angle** — steeper dips are visually more prominent. The panel includes an SVG Wulff net stereonet overview for multiple measurements, a 3D sphere projection view, and per-measurement compass symbols.

### Cross-Section
Two-point line sampled at 200 intervals. For each sample, the surface elevation and all subsurface layers are traced. The panel renders a 720 × 420 px canvas with:
- Colour-coded layer columns with geological hatching patterns (dots, wavy lines, stipple, diagonal hatching, brick, V-shapes)
- Surface profile line with glow
- Water level indicator
- Grid with axis labels and titles

## Performance

The application targets 30–60 fps on integrated graphics (Intel Iris Xe). Key optimisations:

- **InstancedMesh** for all vegetation (single draw call per type)
- **Distance-based LOD** in terrain shader (macro vs detail texture blend)
- **SSAO with 12 taps** (rather than 32–64) with golden-angle kernel rotation
- **Throttled hover** callbacks (~30 fps via `performance.now()` gating)
- **Pixel ratio capped** at 2× to limit fill rate
- **Standard GLSL** (no GLSL 3.0 / WebGL 2.0 features required)
- **Mipmap-filtered** atlas textures to reduce texture bandwidth
- **Procedural textures** — no external image assets to load

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- Chrome 120+ (Windows, macOS)
- Firefox 120+
